# Read Note for [Do ImageNet Classifiers Generalize to ImageNet?](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ludwigs/papers/imagenet.pdf)

## Abstract
 This paper uses experiments to study the generalization of ImageNet classifiers on the new test data set. The authors find that:
 1. They evaluate a broad range of models and find accuracy drops 3% -- 15% on CIFAR-10 and 11% -- 14% on ImageNet.
 2. However, accuracy gaisn on the original test sets translate to larger gains on the new test sets. 
 3. The accuracy drops are not caused by adaptivity, but the models inability to generalize to slightly "harder" images than those found in the original test sets.
